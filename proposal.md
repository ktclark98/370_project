## Project Description

### Purpose
The main **purpose** of our research project is to **predict what makes a successful kickstarter campaign**.
Also, we would like to look at the current kickstarter and other crowd funding market, in order to evaluate the data. We would also look into what kind of campaign does people donate the most.  We would try to make a model for predicting campaign successful rate in different time period. .............(Add why it is important)
### Current Research Papers
The broader problem domain is that **BROADER PROBLOEM DOMAIN**  ....
What kind of research paper in this domain. **Cite three paper here**

### Hypothesis
- What categories, other attributes lead to a more successful kickstarter campaign?
- What are the qualities that make a bad campaign?

### Dataset(s)
[Kaggle Kickstarter-projects dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kemical/kickstarter-projects)
- which is scraped data from the kickstarter website

### Statistical and Machine Learning Methods
- We can use classification models to see the attributes that successful projects share.
- May use KNN and other supervised learning model to predict the successful rate for a new project

### Target Audience
- People looking to crowdsource money for cool projects
- Anyone with a cool idea looking to make money on it
- The funders who want want to get the reward

### Target Audience Questions
- How to build a specific kickstarter campaign that raises the most amount of money from random people
- ....


## Technical Description

### Format
We will use **Python Jupyter Notebook** to generate our report and visualize the graphs.

### Data Management Challenges
The data set we got from the Kaggle is massive, and it cannot directly imported by python. We may need to do some data cleaning before working on it.

### New Technical Skills
- We may need to investigate other supervised learning which fits our problem domain more.
- We need other techniques to clean our data sets.
- We anticipate having to learn more skills, though currently it is hard to say what those will be. Our best guess is that it will focus on learning more skills relevant to machine learning with python packages and creating good in-depth visualizations to display our results.

### Conduct Analysis
Currently, our modeling approach consists of applying the machine learning skills we learned in class in notebook 6. We might also do some logistic modeling and maybe some linear modeling, to have a second angle at which variables are most important to the success (or failure) of a kickstarter. Once we do these initial steps, we will see what are results are at that point and see if/what we want to do beyond the modeling we learned in class.

### Major challenges
What major challenges do you anticipate?
